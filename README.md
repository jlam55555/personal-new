# jlam55555.github.io
The next generation personal website for Jonathan Lam.

Much of the design inspired by Bootstrap (class-based styling), but no libraries were used for the sake of simplicity and speed.

This is the new version of the personal website, forked (essentially) from [personal-new](https://www.github.com/jlam55555/personal-new). For the old design source, see [personal-old](https://www.github.com/jlam55555/personal-old).
